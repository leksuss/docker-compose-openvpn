## Useful tips

### Multiply users via one configuration

This OpenVPN configuration donâ€™t allow connect multiply users via one configuration file by default. If you need to change this behavior, just add this line in server config file:


```
# vim ~/docker-compose-openvpn/openvpn-data/conf/openvpn.conf
duplicate-cn
```

### Routing only internal traffic in VPN

With default OpenVPN configuration file all traffic pass through the OpenVPN server. You can change it by deleting `redirect-gateway def1` from **client config file** and adding this settings:

```
route-nopull
route 10.128.0.0 255.255.255.0
```
You should change IP range and IP mask in `route` settings to yours.
